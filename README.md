# Neopet Helper
This is a collection of python scripts that can be used to automate common Neopet tasks for you. At this time I've only uploaded a couple scripts. I have other scripts to perform dailies, get highscores in games, stock shops, shop wizard search, buy stocks, etc.

I will upload all my scripts with time.

If there's a task you need done let me know and I'll try to get that for you sooner than later if I already have it.

## How to use
Basic python knowledge is needed but to get it running all you have to do is add your username and password to main.py and run it.

### Login
This script is self-explanatory. It allows you to log into your Neopets account by providing your username, password and a Requests session.

### ShopWizard
This script provides a core functionality of the Neopet website and it's to use the Shop Wizard. It can do things like search and find the cheapest price of an item for you. It can also buy an item for you if you wish.

This script provides a lot of potential to the end user to develop snipe bots and auto restocking bots.

## Warning
Use of these scripts may result in your Neopets account being banned (frozen)
